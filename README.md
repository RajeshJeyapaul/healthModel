# healthModel
Step1 : Create a classfication Model using a dataset which contains the pulse data and its realted derived values. Deploy the Model and expose it as WML endpoints Step 2: Register the Mobile device with Watson IoT Step 3: Using the mobile app, generate the LIVE pulse data. This data is published to IoT platform and then stored in a NSQL database Step 4: Read the pulse data from NSQL database and using WML validate it with the deployed model
